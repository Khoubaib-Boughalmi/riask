# Riask - A Journey of Building a Web-Based Project

**Riask** holds a special place in my heart as it was my very first web-based project. Developed using PHP, I embarked on a solo mission to create a CRUD forum website that would enable students from across Tunisia to submit and answer questions.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Riask
- **Technology:** PHP
- **Objective:** Building a CRUD forum website for students in Tunisia

## Project Journey

I started this project from scratch, determined to create a platform where students could engage in discussions and share knowledge. It was an incredible journey from the initial idea to the final production.

### Learning New Features

Throughout the development process, I had the opportunity to explore and learn numerous new features and technologies. Some of the highlights include:

- **AJAX**: Leveraging asynchronous requests to enhance user experience.
- **jQuery**: Employing the power of jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation and interactivity.
- **RESTful API**: Implementing RESTful principles to design a scalable and efficient API.
- **Web Security**: Understanding and implementing best practices to ensure a secure web environment.
- **MySQL**: Managing data using MySQL to store and retrieve forum-related information.

### Deployment and Unfortunate Discontinuation

After completing the project, I deployed Riask to Heroku using the free plan. It provided an accessible platform for users to interact, ask questions, and share their knowledge. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, Heroku discontinued the free plan feature, resulting in the website no longer running.

## Conclusion

Although Riask is no longer accessible, the knowledge and skills gained during its creation will forever stay with me. This project not only showcased my determination and growth as a developer but also taught me the importance of perseverance and adaptability in the face of unexpected challenges.

While Riask's active phase has come to an end, its legacy lives on as a testament to my early achievements in web development.
