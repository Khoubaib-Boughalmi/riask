"Riask" - A Journey of Building a Web-Based Project

Riask holds a special place in my heart as it was my very first web-based project. Developed using PHP, I embarked on a solo mission to create a CRUD forum website that would enable students from across Tunisia to submit and answer questions.

Starting from scratch, I poured my passion into this project, embracing the challenges that came along the way. The journey of building "Riask" was nothing short of amazing, taking me from the initial stages to the final production.

Throughout the development process, I had the opportunity to explore and learn numerous new features and technologies. From mastering AJAX, jQuery, and RESTful APIs to delving into the realms of web security and MySQL database management, every step was a valuable learning experience.

Once completed, the project was deployed to Heroku, utilizing the free plan. It provided a platform for users to interact and benefit from the forum website. However, due to unfortunate circumstances, Heroku discontinued the free plan feature, and as a result, "Riask" is no longer running.

Although the project's active phase has come to an end, the knowledge and skills gained during its creation will forever stay with me. "Riask" not only showcased my determination and growth as a developer but also taught me the importance of perseverance and adaptability in the face of unexpected challenges.

While "Riask" may no longer be accessible, its legacy lives on as a testament to my early achievements in web development.
